4. The discharge from a fully penetrating well operating under steady state in a confined
aquiler of 35 m thickness is 3000 Ipm. Values of drawdown at two observation wells
12 and 120 m away from the well are 3.0 and 0.30 m respectively. Determine the

permeability of the aquifer.

An un—confined aquifer with hydraulic conductivity as 6 m per day located at the top of
a horizontal aquiclude which connects two parallel water bodies A and B which are
1000 m apart. The water surface elevations of A and B. measured above the horizontal
