TUTORIAL SHEET # 6

A confined nquifn_‘r is 25 m thick and 2 km wide. Two observation wells located 2 km
apart in the direction of flow indicate hydrautic head of 45 and 39.5 m. If the coefficient
ut permeability of the aquifer is 30 m/day, calculate (i) total daily flow through the

aquiler. and (ii} piezometric head at an observation well located at 300 m from the
upstream well

2 _A pipe of l:Z m diameter was provided in a reservoir to act as an outlet. Due to disuse,
i: was buried and completely clogged up for some length by sediment deposited.
Mcasurements indicate the presence of fine sand (K; = 10 m/day) deposit for a length
oft 100 m. at the upstream end and of coarse sand (K2= 50 m/day) at the downstream
end for a length of 50 m. In between these two layers the presence of silty sand (K3=0.1
m day) for some length is identified. For a head difference of 20 m on either side of the
clogged length. the seepage discharge is found to be 0.8 m‘/day. Estimate the length of
the pipe filled up with silty sand.

An infiltration gallery taps an unconfined aquifer (K= 50 m/day) situated over a
horizontal impervious bed. For flow conditions shown in the figure below, estimate the
discharge collected per unit length of the gallery.
