2. A pipe of 1.2 m diameter was provided in a reservoir to act as an outlet. Due to disuse,
it was buried and completely clogged up for some iength by sediment deposited.
Measurements indicate the presence of fine sand (Ki = 16 in/day) deposit for a length
of 100 m, at the upstream end and of coarse sand (K2= 50 mi/day) at the downstream
end for a length of 50 m. In between these two layers the presence of silty sand (Kz=0.1
m/day) for some length is identified. For a head difference of 20 m on either side of the
clogged length, the secpage discharge is found to be 0.8 mâ€˜/day. Estimate the length of

the pipe filled up with silty sand.
