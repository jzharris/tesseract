TUTORIAL SHEET # 6

1. A confined aquifer is 25 m thick and 2 km wide. Two observation wells located 2 km
apart in the direction of flow indicate hydraulic head of 45 and 39.5 m. If the coefficient
of permeability of the aquifer is 30 m/day, calculate (i) total daily flow through the
aquifer, and (ii) piezometric head at an observation well located at 300 m from the

upstream well.
