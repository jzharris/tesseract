\ muips of 1.2 m diameter was provided in a reservoir to act as an outlet. Due to disuse,
t was buried and completely clogged up for some length by sediment deposited.
Mcasurements indicate the presence of fine sand (K; = 10 m/day) deposit for a length
«i 100 m, at the upstream end and of coarse sand (K2= 50 m/day) at the downstream
end for a length of 50 m. In between these two layers the presence of silty sand (Ks=0.1
im day } for some length is identified. For a head difference of 20 m on either side of the
clopged length, the seepage discharge is found to be 0.8 m‘/day. Estimate the length of
the pipe filled up with silty sand.

An infiltration gallery taps an unconfined aquifer (K= 50 m/day) situated over a
horizontal impery ious bed. For flow conditions shown in the figure below, estimate the
discharge collected per unit length of the gallery.
