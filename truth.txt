1. A confined aquifer is 25 m thick and 2 km wide. Two observation wells located 2 km 
apart in the direction of flow indicate hydraulic head of 45 and 39.5 m. Ifthe coefficient 
of permeability Of the aquifer is 30 m/day, calculate (i) total daily flow through the 
aquifer. and (ii) piezometric head at an observation well located at 300 m from the 
upstream well. 
2. A pipe of 1.2 m diameter was provided in a reservoir to act as an outlet. Due to disuse, 
it was buried and completely clogged up for some length by sediment deposited. 
Measurements indicate the presence of fine sand (K1 = 10 m/day) deposit for a length 
of 100 m, at the upstream end and of coarse sand (K2= 50 m/day) at the downstream 
end for a length of 5O m. In between these two layers the presence of silty sand (K3=0.1 
m/day) for some length is identified. For a head difference of 20 m on either side of the 
clogged length, the seepage discharge is found to be 0.8 m3/day. Estimate the length of 
the pipe filled up with silty sand. 
3. An infiltration gallery taps an unconfined aquifer (K= 50 m/day) situated over a 
horizontal impervious bed. For flow conditions shown in the figure below, estimate the 
discharge collected per unit length of the gallery. 
4. The discharge from a fully penetrating well operating under steady state in a confined 
aquifer of 35 m thickness is 3000 lpm. Values of drawdown at two observation wells 
12 and 120 m away from the well are 3.0 and 0.30 m respectively. Determine the 
permeability of the aquifer. 
5. An un-confined aquifer with hydraulic conductivity as 6m per day located at the top of 
a horizontal aquiclude which connects two parallel water bodies A and B which are 
1000 m apart. The water surface elevations of A and B, measured above the horizontal 
aquiclude, are 12.0 m and 9.0 m. If a uniform recharge rate of 0.003 m3/day per m2 of 
horizontal area occurs on the ground surface, estimate the followings: 
a. The potentiometric surface profile. 
b. The location and elevation of Water Table. 
c. The seepage discharges into the lakes. 
d. The recharge rate and total seepage flow per unit width of the aquifer.
